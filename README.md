#   Wavy Waveforms (2018)

An audio/visual informational program meant to showcase information regarding the human hearing range and folded frequencies, while also explaining really briefly how different waveforms are built through the use of sine waves and summations. 

It allows the user to build either a square wave, a saw wave, or a triangle wave by adding up the harmonics one by one,giving them a visual and auditive representation of what’s going on, while also letting them change the waveform’s frequency. The program was made with openFrameworks, using ofxMaxim as the audio engine.

A brief demo of the program can be seen here: https://vimeo.com/512095109
